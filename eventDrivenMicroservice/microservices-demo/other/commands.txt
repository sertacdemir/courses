- docker-compose -f common.yml -f kafka_cluster.yml up -d
- docker-compose -f common.yml -f services.yml up
# (There was a lot of issue and I have put here the working example of kafka. There was a need of restart of some brokers)


# kafkacat
- brew install kafkacat
- kafkacat -L -b localhost:19092
